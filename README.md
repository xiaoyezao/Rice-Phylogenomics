# SynNet-Py
The code was used in our rice genome evolution paper (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.29.596369) to generate microsynteny gene clusters. The main function is:
1) to process and clean the pangene table from GENESPACE;
2) to identify syntenic gene clusters

The output then can be used as input for plotting in the R package syntenet (https://github.com/almeidasilvaf/syntenet).

The whole pipeline is represented in the jupyter notebook; python3.x and pandans module are required to run the scripts
